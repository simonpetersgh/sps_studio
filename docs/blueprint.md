## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5DADE2) for a professional and trustworthy feel, derived from the concepts of innovation and insights.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF5FB), a desaturated version of the primary, for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Light violet (#25364A) for call-to-actions and highlights. This creates contrast while staying in an analogous color range.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Headline text: 'Playfair', serif. 'Playfair' / 'PT Sans' serif/sans-serif pairing gives an elegant yet modern feel.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent skills and services. The icons should be consistent in style and size.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain visual consistency and modularity. White space should be used generously to separate content blocks.
- Use subtle fade-in animations for section transitions and hover effects on interactive elements, such as buttons and project cards.
